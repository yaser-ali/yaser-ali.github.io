                                    A well-presented, friendly, hardworking, and highly technical individual with a passion for technology, programming and of course, development. I am a graduate who graduated with a strong upper second in software development at the Manchester Metropolitan University. I am currently specializing, working, and developing applications for companies and organizations.
                                    As a developer, I enjoy solving problems and developing substantial, quantitative, and readable code. But also, the way an application is developed such as its design, UI (User Interface), and functionality. I am comfortable working with an agile software development team and giving ideas for development practices.
                                    Proficient knowledge in PHP and Java, especially in many different programming languages and technologies such as node.js, Java, HTML5, React.js, vue.js, Python and C#. I do make extensive use of GIT and among other favourable software frameworks. I have been working on web applications during my adolescent years, but I also worked on a couple of software applications.
